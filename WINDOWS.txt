This is an Windows x86_64 port of SILENTARMY v5.
I quickly hacked this up, so use this at your own risk.
All you have to do is to install the Cygwin version of
Python 3.4 and edit and run "start.bat". 

Cygwin can be downloaded at: https://cygwin.com/index.html
Make sure to select the "Python3: Py3K language interpreter"
package under "Python". PLEASE NOTE THAT THE OFFICIAL
WINDOWS VERSION OF PYTHON DOES NOT WORK WITH THIS BINARY!

If you find this port useful and/or would like to see 
a feature-rich ZEC miner based on it, please consider
donations to:

Last but not least, mrb, nerdralph, eXtremal, and Genoil,
thank you all so much for the great work. You guys are 
truly the cream of the FOSS movement.
